# Covid-19-Detection-Using-Xray-images
Simple chest X-ray radiographs can diagnose the patients for COVID infection, as proposed by a neural network-based model, ResNet50. The ROC analyses and confusion matrices produced by this model are analyzed through 5-fold cross-validation. Experimental results suggest that a pre-trained ResNet50 model delivers an accuracy rate of 90%.
